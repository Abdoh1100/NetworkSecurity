can you mention the network security best practice implementation in regards to routing and switching according to guidance from CISA


Network Security Best Practices for Routing and Switching
1. Access Control
Implement Strong Authentication: Use strong, multi-factor authentication 
(MFA) for accessing network devices.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Limit access to network devices based on 
roles and responsibilities. Ensure that only authorized personnel have 
administrative privileges.
Limit Remote Access: Disable remote access to network devices when not 
necessary. If remote access is required, use secure methods like SSH or 
VPNs.
2. Device Hardening
Update Firmware and Software: Regularly update the firmware and software 
of network devices to patch known vulnerabilities.
Disable Unused Services: Turn off any services and interfaces that are not 
in use to reduce the attack surface.
Default Settings: Change default passwords, SNMP community strings, and 
other default settings to unique, strong values.
3. Secure Network Management
Encrypted Management Protocols: Use encrypted management protocols (e.g., 
SSH, HTTPS) instead of unencrypted ones (e.g., Telnet, HTTP).
Out-of-Band Management: Where possible, use out-of-band management 
networks to manage network devices separately from the data traffic.
Logging and Monitoring: Enable logging on network devices and regularly 
monitor logs for suspicious activities. Forward logs to a central logging 
server for analysis.
4. Network Segmentation
VLANs: Use VLANs to segment different types of traffic, such as separating 
user traffic from management traffic.
DMZ: Implement a demilitarized zone (DMZ) for public-facing services to 
isolate them from the internal network.
Zero Trust Architecture: Apply the principles of zero trust, ensuring that 
each segment of the network enforces strict access controls and does not 
inherently trust any traffic.
5. Routing Security
Secure Routing Protocols: Use secure versions of routing protocols (e.g., 
OSPFv3, BGP with MD5 authentication) to prevent route injection attacks.
Route Filtering: Implement route filtering to control the advertisement 
and acceptance of routes, preventing the propagation of incorrect routing 
information.
Prefix Lists and Access Control Lists (ACLs): Use prefix lists and ACLs to 
control which networks are advertised or accepted by routing protocols.
6. Switching Security
Port Security: Configure port security on switches to limit the number of 
devices that can connect to a port, protecting against MAC flooding 
attacks.
Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI): Enable DAI to prevent ARP spoofing attacks 
by validating ARP packets against trusted sources.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Guard: Enable STP guard features like BPDU 
Guard to prevent unauthorized devices from affecting the STP topology.
7. Network Address Translation (NAT) and Private Addressing
Use NAT: Implement NAT to hide internal IP addresses from external 
networks, making it more difficult for attackers to target internal 
devices.
Private IP Addressing: Use private IP address ranges (e.g., RFC 1918 
addresses) within the internal network and avoid using public IP addresses 
for internal devices.
8. Physical Security
Control Physical Access: Ensure that network devices are physically 
secured and accessible only to authorized personnel.
Environmental Controls: Maintain appropriate environmental controls, such 
as temperature and humidity monitoring, to ensure the optimal operation of 
network devices.

By implementing these best practices, organizations can significantly 
enhance the security of their routing and switching infrastructure, 
reducing the risk of network-based attacks and ensuring the integrity and 
availability of their network services.
