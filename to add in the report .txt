segmentation : 
- vlans creation in the new site performing ROAS on the router for inter vlan routing 
- performing vlsm subnetting for the site to make use of the available ip space 
- add the configuration on sw 1 and sw0 and s2-r on the appendencies 
- add a picture for s2 topology 


for the HQ : 
- interface g0/7 the router wasnt up 
- ip address wasnt set 
-ip of the routers was not in the same range 
- repairing all R1HQ ip and links 
- i did make sure that all the connections are going right pinging all to all 




- questions should we manipulate any ips ? 
- is it possible to use l3 switch in our topology ? to use svis routing between vlans ? 
- what about the report is the marking will be restricted that much ?
